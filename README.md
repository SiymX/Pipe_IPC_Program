# Pipe_IPC_Program
This program is a C language implementation of a simple Inter-Process communication (IPC) using a pipe. 
The program reads the content of a file, sends it through the pipe to another process, and counts the number of words in the file.


Make sure you are running it on a working version of ubuntu. Follow this command:
gcc pipe_prog.c -o pipe

If everything is done correctly then it will compile and you can run the program using:
./pipe
