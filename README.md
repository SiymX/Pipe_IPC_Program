# Pipe IPC Program (Word Counter)
This program is a C language implementation of a simple Inter-Process communication (IPC) using a pipe. 
The program reads the content of a file, sends it through the pipe to another process, and counts the number of words in the file.

Please be aware you will need a ```".txt"``` file for the program to read from the file. You can change "test.txt" to anything you want for the program to work. 

Make sure you are running it on a working version of ubuntu. To compile it, run this command:
```gcc pipe_prog.c -o pipe```

If everything is done correctly then it will compile and you can run the program using:
```./pipe```
